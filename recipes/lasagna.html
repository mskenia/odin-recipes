    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted
        cheese. The key to great lasagna is slow-cooked sauce and perfectly cooked noodles that hold their shape.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>To prepare it, start by making a meat sauce with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. Then layer it
    with pasta sheets, béchamel sauce, and mozzarella in a baking dish. Bake until golden and bubbly — and let it
    rest before serving for the best flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles (pre-cooked or oven-ready)</li>
        <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2–3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>800g (28 oz) canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>50g (3 tbsp) butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>500 ml (2 cups) milk</li>
        <li>A pinch of nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>200g (2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>50g (½ cup) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce:</strong>
            <br>
            Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until soft. Add minced garlic and
            cook for another 30 seconds. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste, crushed
            tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Let simmer on low heat for 20–30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the béchamel sauce:</strong>
            <br>
            In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1–2 minutes. Gradually
            add milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper,
            and a pinch of nutmeg if desired. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</strong></li>
        <li><b>Assemble the lasagna:</b>
            <br>
            Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles. Then
            spread meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and a handful of mozzarella. Repeat the layers until all ingredients
            are used, finishing with béchamel and cheese on top. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            <br>
            Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15–20 minutes, until the top
            is golden and bubbling.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong>
            <br>
            Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes serving
            easier.
        </li>
    </ol>
