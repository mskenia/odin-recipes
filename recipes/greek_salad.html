    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish from Naples, known for its simplicity and bold flavors.
        Made with just a few pantry staples — garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, and pasta — it’s the perfect example of
        how minimal ingredients can deliver maximum flavor.</p>
    <p>The dish is garlicky, slightly spicy, and rich in olive oil, with a silky texture thanks to the starchy pasta
        water. It’s quick to make and incredibly satisfying — ideal for a weeknight dinner or a late-night craving.
    </p>
    <p>You can serve it as is, or top it with fresh parsley and grated Parmesan for extra depth and color.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili flakes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong>
            <br>Boil spaghetti in salted water until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the garlic:</strong>
            <br>In a pan over low heat, add olive oil and sliced garlic. Cook until lightly golden — do not burn!
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add chili flakes:</strong>
            <br>Stir in red pepper flakes and cook for a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine with pasta:</strong>
            <br>Add drained pasta to the pan and toss well. Pour in some reserved pasta water to loosen and coat the
            spaghetti.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <br>Plate immediately. Top with chopped parsley and grated cheese if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
